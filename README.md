# README --- Ian Murphy

## Welcome

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm so glad you're here! You may be wondering what's going on here. Well, this repository exists so that I can submit my assignments for **STAT 545A**. All of my submissions will be in this repo! 

The assignments will be organized as follows:

1. There will be an individual folder for each assignment. For example, Assignment 01 will be a folder labeled *hw01*.
2. Within each folder, you will find the files associated with each assignment. This will depend on how many questions are involved within each assignment.

### About Me

Now, enough with the boring stuff; let's talk about me :bowtie: ! 

I am a 1st year Master's student at UBC where I'm studying Biostatistics. I am super interested in the design and analysis of clinical trials, as well as the development of new techniques related to longitudinal data. To some, that sounds boring, but to me, it's super exciting! 

Aside from school, I love watching Netflix, playing the guitar, shooting pictures with my camera, and practicing yoga. I'm also new to Vancouver, and I am really looking forward to exploring the city and all it has to offer. I'm already in love with the scenery and the weather. I tend to enjoy travelling and exploring, so this will be the perfect opportunity for me!

In the wise words of Dr. Seuss:

> Oh, the places you'll go!

Oh, and one last thing. I love the *Real Housewives* franchise. I currently watch Beverly Hills, New York, and Potomac. This is also the perfect time to insert the best quote ever:
